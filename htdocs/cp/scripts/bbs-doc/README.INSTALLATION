While many scripts on this archive have a README.INSTALLATION script, this
one does not.  However, most of the code and the installation procedures
are well documented in "Instant Web Scripts With CGI/Perl" published by
M&T Press. The book, including the chapter on this application, can be
found online at www.extropia.com.
